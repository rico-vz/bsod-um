# BSOD UM

Raise a quick BSOD from Usermode without the need of Administrative permissions.

This is done by using the undocumented "NtRaiseHardError" function.
You can find more information about this here: http://undocumented.ntinternals.net/index.html?page=UserMode%2FUndocumented%20Functions%2FError%2FNtRaiseHardError.html


## Warning

Running this WILL cause your Windows system to BSOD and lose all unsaved progress in your applications.
